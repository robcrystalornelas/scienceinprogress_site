      <description>In this episode, I sit down with Priya Shukla of UC Davis&amp;rsquo; Bodega Marine Lab. Over the past couple of years, Priya has worked as lab manager for the Ocean Acidification group at BML. Recently, she accepted a spot in UC Davis&amp;rsquo; Ecology PhD program! Priya discusses what it&amp;rsquo;s like to work as a lab manager (for 3 different labs at once!) and what it was like applying to grad school amidst all the work at BML.</description>
