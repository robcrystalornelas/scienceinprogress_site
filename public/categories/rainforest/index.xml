      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m joined by Diego Balbuena who just finished up his undergrad degree at Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in Lima, Peru! In this episode we talk about Diego&amp;rsquo;s path to becoming an ecologist. Diego took a couple of years off to develop skills in studying the wildlife that live in rainforest canopies. He has fantastic tales from the field as well as a real passion for the ecology research that he conducts.</description>
