      <description>In today’s episode I chat with Manuel Lequerica, a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney. We talk about the fascinating aspects of urban ecology including light pollution, human connection with nature and plant/insect interactions. We also have fun discussions about what it’s like to follow different passions for research and why it’s OK to be fascinated by lots of different things. Thanks to Manuel for this episode!! Also, thank you Alejandra Echeverri for introducing us.</description>

      <description>Anna&amp;rsquo;s a PhD student at University of Connecticut. She studies bat viruses which is super cool! We talk a little about Anna&amp;rsquo;s research, but this discussion we focus on methods for coping when things don&amp;rsquo;t go as planned in research or our overall grad school plans.

      <description>So excited to be joined by Laura Abondano on this episode. Laura and I started chatting about recording this show about a year ago.

We hear all about Laura&amp;rsquo;s research and what it&amp;rsquo;s like studying primates in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest.
Laura has a website with colleagues where they post awesome info about woolly monkeys.</description>
