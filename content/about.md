*Science in Progress* is a podcast presented by the [ESA Student Section](https://www.esastudents.org/).  The podcast is hosted by me, Rob Crystal-Ornelas.  I'm a 4th year PhD student in Ecology & Evolution.  In each episode, I interview graduate students, research technicians or undergrads.  We have fun and honest conversations about what it's like to learn how to be a scientist.
