*Science in Progress* is a podcast hosted by me, Rob Crystal-Ornelas.  In May of 2019 I received my PhD in Ecology and Evolution from Rutgers University.  I am fascinated by different educational pathways to science, and started this podcast so that students in science careers can share their stories.  In each episode, I interview graduate students, research technicians, or undergrads all about their start to careers in science.
