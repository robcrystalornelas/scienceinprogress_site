In today’s episode I chat with Manuel Lequerica, a PhD candidate at the University of Sydney. We talk about the fascinating aspects of urban ecology including light pollution, human connection with nature and plant/insect interactions. We also have fun discussions about what it’s like to follow different passions for research and why it’s OK to be fascinated by lots of different things. Thanks to Manuel for this episode!! Also, thank you Alejandra Echeverri for introducing us. If you haven’t listened to the episode I recorded with Ale, you should! (It’s episode number 13).

Manuel's lab is [here](https://sydney.edu.au/science/our-research/research-areas/life-and-environmental-sciences/integrative-ecology-lab.html)

Manuel is also part of [this](http://www.tanyalatty.com/) research group.

Manuel has a [blog](https://lacomidasobrelamesa.blogspot.com/) and find him on twitter as @M_Lequerica
