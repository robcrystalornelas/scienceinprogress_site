I'm joined by **Diego Balbuena** who just finished up his undergrad degree at Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in Lima, Peru!  In this episode we talk about Diego's path to becoming an ecologist.  Diego took a couple of years off to develop skills in studying the wildlife that live in rainforest canopies.  He has fantastic tales from the field as well as a real passion for the ecology research that he conducts.
