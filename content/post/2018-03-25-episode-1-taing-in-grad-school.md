The very first episode of *Science in Progress* is now available.  In this episode, I'm joined by [Katie Thompson](https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/people/kathleen-thompson) of Iowa State University.  As a PhD student, Katie studies lichen diversity in Iowa.  Katie also has been teaching since her early days in grad school and she shares some of the techinques that she uses in the classroom to keep students engaged and excited.  Big thanks to Katie for joining me on the first episode.  Hope you all enjoy!

As a side note, you should be able to find this episode with Katie anywhere you get podcasts.  It's on iTunes, Stitcher, Overcast and also you can stream it via the link in the top right corner of this page.  I'm working on uploading it to Spotify, so you should see it there in the next few days.
