In this episode, I chat with Meredith Zettlemoyer a PhD candidate at Michigan State University who works at the Kellogg Biological Station. Meredith studies responses of prarie communities to different aspects of global change like nitrogen addition, deer herbivory and climate change.  In this episode we chat about what it's like to have many different work experiences while being a student. Meredith's journey was shaped by jobs working with AmeriCorps and as a writer. I made sure to ask Meredith for lots of writing suggestions! She also listed this book by Chimamanda Adichie as her favorite and I'm excited to read it soon [Half of a Yellow Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun)
