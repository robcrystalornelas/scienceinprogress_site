So excited to be joined by Laura Abondano on this episode. Laura and I started chatting about recording this show about a year ago. I found Laura's work on the website [500 women scientists](https://500womenscientists.org). She studies woolly monkey reproductive behaviors and paternity patterns. We hear all about Laura's research and what it's like studying primates in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest.
