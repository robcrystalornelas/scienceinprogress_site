On today's podcast I chat with Alejandra Echeverri who is a Phd candidate at the University of British Columbia and environmental consultant.  Ale describes environmental consulting work and tells us about some of her past and current projects.  She describes ways to get involved in consulting as a way to engage with ecological research and as a potential career path.
