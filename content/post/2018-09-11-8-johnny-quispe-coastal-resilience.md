Johnny joins me on the podcast to discuss his research on coastal resilience and climate change.  Johnny's currently a PhD student at Rutgers University.  He switched over to the PhD program after spending time in a masters program at Rutgers.  We talk about some of his decision-making behind the switch.

Johnny also won the [ESA's graduate student policy award](https://www.esa.org/esa/tag/hill-days/)!
