In today's episode I talk with Gina Ramirez, a PhD candidate at Centro de Investigaciones Biológicas del Noroeste in La Paz, Mexico.  Gina and I met just over a year ago when I was an instructor with the NGO Clubes de Ciencia.  Gina is one of the amazingly dedicated staff members in La Paz and with the team there, she coordinates 1 week workshops for undergraduates in Mexico that are all about science!  We also get to hear about Gina's exciting research that includes analyzing data about fish communities in national parks and a National Geographic funded project involving an underwater ROV.
