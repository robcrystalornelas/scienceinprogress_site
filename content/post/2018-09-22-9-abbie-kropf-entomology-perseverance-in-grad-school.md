In this episode I chat with Abbie Kropf a 2nd year PhD student at Iowa State University.Â  Abbie is in the department of entomology at Iowa State. In this episode, we talk about how Abbie started in her Masters research in Costa Rica. She spend multiple seasons in Costa Rica studying forest fragmentation with Dr. Mike Wasserman and Dr. Peter Beck.

We also have a great discussion about perserserverance in grad school and suggestions for finding grad school labs that will be a good fit.

As a side note, Abbie was incredibly kind when my dog began barking mid-recording. Thanks, Abbie!!
