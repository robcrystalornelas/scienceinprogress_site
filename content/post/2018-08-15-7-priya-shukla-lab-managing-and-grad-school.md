In this episode, I sit down with Priya Shukla of UC Davis' Bodega Marine Lab.  Over the past couple of years, Priya has worked as lab manager for the Ocean Acidification group at BML.  Recently, she accepted a spot in UC Davis' Ecology PhD program!  Priya discusses what it's like to work as a lab manager (for 3 different labs at once!) and what it was like applying to grad school amidst all the work at BML. We talk a bit about Priya's career trajectory and Priya shares some awesome advice about how to get involved in this field that we like so much.
